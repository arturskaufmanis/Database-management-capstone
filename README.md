## üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture

### Table Structure
```sql
-- Author table
CREATE TABLE author (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    country TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Book table with foreign key relationship
CREATE TABLE book (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    authorID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    qty INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (authorID) REFERENCES author(id)
);
```

### Core Functions
```python
def create_database():
    """Initialize SQLite database with tables and sample data"""
